Problem:  https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/symmetric-pairs/problem?isFullScreen=true

You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

Sample Output

20 20
20 21
22 23


My Solution:--

SELECT A.X,A.Y
FROM FUNCTIONS A
JOIN FUNCTIONS B
ON A.X = B.Y
AND B.X = A.Y
GROUP BY A.X,A.Y
HAVING COUNT(A.X)>1 OR A.X<A.Y
ORDER BY A.X;
